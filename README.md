# slackme

A little web app that helps to deploy a tiny web portal so users can auto-invite themselves to Slack workspaces.

# Motivation

I work with several open-source communities, and many of them started using IRC. It's also impossible to work against people using one app or another; people use whatever they want; Slack, IRC, Discord, Telegram, etc., and many communities out there don't have the money to spend on Slack. Slack It's fantastic, but expensive for local communities.

Also, several well-known apps doing the same started getting deprecated, and after analyzing the needed fixes I preferred to start from scratch following the up-to-date Slack API documentation.
